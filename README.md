Chen, Shi-Shun and Xiao-Yang Li. "A new moment-independent uncertainty importance measure based on cumulative residual entropy for developing uncertainty reduction strategies." Mathematics and Computers in Simulation. 2026, 239: 263-281.

## Highlights

• Quantifying uncertainty magnitude is important in practical uncertainty reduction.

• CRE-based measures are developed for handling highly-skewed distributions.

• Numerical implementations are devised to estimate the proposed measure.

• A case of uncertainty reduction considering uncertainty magnitude is introduced.

• The proposed measure gives a different recommendation compared to the Sobol index.
